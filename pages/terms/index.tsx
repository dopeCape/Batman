        Fees and payment
      </h2>
      <p>
        Payment and pricing terms for the Service are as specified in the order
        form utilized to order such subscriptions. By selecting a premium
        service you agree to pay Metridash the monthly or annual subscription
        fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on the day you
        sign up for a premium service and will cover the use of that service for
        a monthly or annual period as indicated. Premium service fees are not
        refundable. Metridash offers monthly and annual subscriptions that renew
        until they are canceled by the user. Your subscription will
        automatically renew for another period unless notice of non-renewal is
        provided. Your notice of non-renewal must be received before the renewal
        period begins. You will be billed for the Service until you properly
        cancel your account or Metridash terminates your account. Your
        cancellation may not take effect until completion of the current billing
        cycle. Prices for the Service are subject to change upon 30 days notice
        from Metridash. This notice may be posted on the Metridash website or
        may appear with the Service itself. If you do not agree to the price
        change(s), you may cancel your account during this 30-day period. By
        continuing to use the Service after the effective date of a pricing
        change, you thereby agree to such pricing change. Metridash shall not be
        liable to you or to any third party for any modifications to the Service
        or prices.
